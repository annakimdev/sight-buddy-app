## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongo DB, Bootstrap

Math.Random() method is used to choose and display a word from a list of words. High frequency words compiled by Dr. Dolch is available for grades Pre-K to 3rd. [Web Speech API](https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/) is utilized to generate sound of the words. Languages available in the user's browser are listed for selection.

## Optimizations

 Text transform to be used to provide options to display words in lowercase, uppercase, and capitalize. Filter for grade level can be added to improve Explore screen's usability.

## Lessons Learned:

At first, Korean was hard coded as an alternative language for my child. However, Korean only worked on Chrome browser , which I was testing with. It was a different language on Safari. To address this issue, all the available languages in the user's browser is listed for selection. Giving the choice to the user was a huge improvement on usability.
